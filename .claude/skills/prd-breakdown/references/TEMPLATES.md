## Template 3: research-notes.md

Created **IF research was conducted** (internal or external).

```markdown
# Research Notes: [Section Title]

> Research Date: [Date research was performed]
> Researcher: Claude PRD Breakdown Skill
> Methods: [Internal codebase analysis | Web search | Both]

## Internal Research (Codebase)

### Finding 1: [Topic or Component Name]
**Query**: [What was searched for]
**Method**: `search_for_pattern("[search term]")` or code navigation
**Location**: `src/path/to/file.py:45-120` (if applicable)
**Finding**: [What was discovered]
**Relevance**: [How this applies to the requirement]
**Code Snippet**:
```python
[Key code excerpt if relevant - keep concise]
```
**Implication**: [What this means for implementation]

Example:
```
Finding: Existing Razorpay Integration

Query: Search for "razorpay" in codebase

Method: Codebase search using find_symbol

Location: src/services/payment_service.py:45-120

Finding: RazorpayClient class exists with:
- Checkout integration for one-time payments
- Webhook handling for payment confirmations
- Rate limiting (100 requests/min)

Relevance: Can extend for coin recharge and creator payouts (REQ-RM-012, REQ-CP-005)

Code Snippet:
class RazorpayClient:
    def create_checkout(self, amount, user_id):
        # Creates payment checkout link
        ...

    def verify_payment(self, payment_id, signature):
        # Verifies webhook signature
        ...

Implication: We can reuse existing Razorpay integration patterns but need to add:
1. Recurring payment support for subscriptions
2. Refund handling for disputes
3. Creator payout processing
```

### Finding 2: [Next Finding]
[Same format...]

[Continue for all internal findings...]

## External Research (Web)

### Finding 1: [Topic - e.g., "Competitor Revenue Share"]
**Query**: [Google search query used]
**Source Name**: [Publication or website]
**URL**: [https://example.com/article]
**Date Accessed**: [Date research was conducted]
**Reliability**: High | Medium | Low
**Finding**: [What was discovered]
**Key Excerpt**: "[Direct quote from source]"
**Relevance**: [How this validates or informs requirement]
**Citation**: [Full citation for academic/compliance research]

Example:
```
Finding: FRND Creator Revenue Share Comparison

Query: "FRND app creator revenue share 2026"

Source Name: TechCrunch

URL: https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/indian-social-apps-creators

Date Accessed: 2026-01-18

Reliability: High (reputable tech journalism source)

Finding: FRND offers 50-55% creator share after platform fees (30% app store cut)

Key Excerpt: "FRND, one of India's fastest-growing voice chat apps, splits revenue 50-50 with creators after Apple/Google's cut, positioning itself as creator-first in the market."

Relevance: Validates PRD claim (REQ-RM-008) that competitors offer "50-60% creator share". Our proposed 60% is competitive and slightly above market rate.

## Template 4: design-decisions.md

Created **ONLY for technical sections** (05, 06, 07, 08): Feature Specifications, Technical Architecture, Database Schema, API Specifications.

```markdown
# Design Decisions: [Section Title]

> Decision Date: [Date decisions were made]
> Deciders: [User Name], Development Team
> Review Status: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated

## DD-[ABBREV]-001: [Decision Title]

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated
**Deciders**: [Name], [Name]
**Date**: [Date decided]
**Last Updated**: [If revised]

### Context
[What problem are we solving? What constraints exist?]

Example:
```
The Feature Specifications require real-time updates for notifications.
We need to decide between:
1. WebSocket connections (persistent)
2. Server-Sent Events/SSE (simpler but less bi-directional)
3. Long-polling (simplest but less efficient)

Constraints:
- Must work across geographies (India, international)
- Must handle poor network conditions gracefully
- Must support mobile (battery efficiency important)
- Must scale to 50K concurrent users
```

### Decision
[What we decided to do]

Example:
```
We will use WebSockets with graceful fallback to long-polling.

Primary: WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication
Fallback: Long-polling for clients that don't support WebSockets
Implementation: Use Socket.io library (built-in fallback handling)
```

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Option A: WebSocket Only**
   - **Pros**:
     - True real-time, low latency
     - Bi-directional communication
     - Efficient for high-frequency updates
   - **Cons**:
     - Doesn't work with old proxies/networks
     - Higher server memory per connection
     - Mobile client complexity (battery drain)

2. **Option B: Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
   - **Pros**:
     - Native browser support
     - Simpler than WebSocket
     - Good for one-way (server→client) updates
   - **Cons**:
     - Unidirectional only
     - No standardized client connection state
     - Polling still needed for client→server

3. **Option C: Long-Polling Only**
   - **Pros**:
     - Works everywhere (no special infrastructure)
     - Simpler implementation
     - No persistent connections
   - **Cons**:
     - Higher latency (polling interval)
     - More requests = higher bandwidth
     - Doesn't scale well to 50K users

### Rationale
[Why we chose this over alternatives]

Example:
```
We chose WebSocket with fallback because:
1. It meets the real-time requirement while being resilient to network conditions
2. Socket.io handles fallback automatically, so deployment is simpler
3. For our scale (50K users), WebSocket overhead is manageable with proper connection pooling
4. The fallback to long-polling means we won't lose users on restrictive networks
5. Industry standard for real-time apps (established best practice)
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Users get real-time notifications (improves engagement)
- Works across diverse network conditions
- Proven technology with strong library support (Socket.io)
- Easy to scale with message broker (Redis Pub/Sub)

**Negative**:
- Added complexity: server must manage persistent connections
- Requires load-balancing awareness (sticky sessions or Redis)
- Mobile clients must handle connection lifecycle
- Testing complexity increases

**Risks**:
- If connection pool exhaustion occurs: impact on all users on that server
- Mitigation: Set strict connection limits, implement circuit breaker
- Memory usage scales with concurrent users: need monitoring/alerts
- Mitigation: Capacity planning, horizontal scaling

### Related Requirements
- REQ-FS-012: Real-time notifications for calls
- REQ-FS-018: Presence indicators (online/offline status)
- REQ-TA-008: Scalability to 50K concurrent users

### Implementation Notes
- Use Socket.io v4.0+ for native fallback support
- Configure connection limits: 1000 per server
- Implement disconnect/reconnect logic (exponential backoff)
- Monitor connection pool health with metrics

# Requirements: Executive Summary

> Extracted from: `PRD/LIVVLY_Voice_Dating_App_PRD.md` (Lines 1-45)
> Breakdown Date: 2026-01-18
> Last Updated: 2026-01-18

## Overview
The Executive Summary defines LIVVLY's position as a creator-first, voice-focused dating and social platform designed for India's emerging market. This section captures the product's core value proposition, target audience, business goals, and differentiation from existing alternatives like Hike, Instagram, and traditional dating apps.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-ES-001: Support Primary User Base - Voice-First Dating
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Type**: Functional
**Description**: Platform must enable voice-first interactions (calls, live rooms) for dating and social connection, with text/video as secondary modalities
**Rationale**: This is the core differentiation from text-first social apps and swipe-based dating apps (from Q&A with user)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Users can initiate voice calls with matches
- [ ] Users can join live voice rooms (group calls)
- [ ] Voice quality remains acceptable on 3G networks
- [ ] Users can fall back to text messaging if voice unavailable

**Dependencies**: REQ-FS-016 (Live Voice Room), REQ-API-031 (Room Endpoints)
**Related Design Decisions**: DD-TA-005 (Real-time Communication Choice), DD-FS-001 (Voice Quality Targets)
**Notes**: Validated in Q&A that voice calling is the primary interaction model, not a secondary feature

---

### REQ-ES-002: Target 50K Active Users in Year 1
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Type**: Business
**Description**: Platform must be designed, launched, and scaled to achieve 50K weekly active users by end of year 1
**Rationale**: This is the primary business goal (from user interview)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Architecture supports minimum 50K concurrent users
- [ ] All features implemented to support 50K+ scaling
