## Decision Frameworks

### When Making Product Decisions
1. **Does it serve the vision?** (3-5 year North Star)
2. **Does it advance the mission?** (Daily operational commitment)
3. **Does it align with values?** (Use conflict resolution hierarchy if unsure)
4. **Does it fit the user journey?** (Does it move users through funnel?)
5. **Does it differentiate competitively?** (Advances 75-85% payout, regional language, or AI)

### When in Conflict
Use the **Value Priority Hierarchy:**
1. Safety: All other values secondary to user/creator safety
2. Creator-First: Creator sustainability prioritized over user acquisition
3. Transparency: Clear communication about decisions and trade-offs
4. Accessibility: Expand reach without compromising other values

**Example:** If moderation slows growth, safety wins → slower growth is acceptable.
