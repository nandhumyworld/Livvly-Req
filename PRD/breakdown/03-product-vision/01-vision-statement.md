2. **Regional Expansion:** After South India dominance, should expansion be to North India or to other languages in South India?
3. **AI Integration:** How prominently should AI companions feature in the long-term vision vs. human creators?
4. **Revenue Target:** Is ₹5Cr GMV a floor or ceiling? What's the ideal growth trajectory?
