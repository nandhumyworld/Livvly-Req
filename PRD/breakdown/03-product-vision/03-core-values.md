## Core Values Framework

LIVVLY operates on four foundational values that guide all decisions, product features, and team culture:

---

## Value 1: Creator-First

**Definition:** Creators are the heart of LIVVLY. Every decision prioritizes creator success, sustainability, and satisfaction.

### What This Value Means

- **Priority Over Users:** If there's a conflict between user growth and creator earnings, creator earnings win
- **Sustainable Income:** Creators should be able to earn meaningful livelihood from the platform
- **Transparency:** Clear, predictable economics; no hidden deductions or arbitrary changes
- **Respect:** Treat creators as business partners, not suppliers

### Business Implications

| Area | Creator-First Approach |
|------|------------------------|
| **Revenue Share** | 75-85% vs. competitors' 50-60% |
| **Payout Speed** | T+1 (next business day) |
| **Contracts** | Multi-year guarantees, not month-to-month |
| **Product Features** | Analytics, promotion tools, creator support built-in |
| **Pricing Changes** | 30-day notice minimum; no retroactive reductions |
| **Deductions** | No hidden fees; only transparent TDS/regulatory deductions |

### Operational Commitments

- [ ] All payout disputes resolved within 48 hours
- [ ] Creator onboarding includes financial literacy on earnings model
- [ ] Quarterly creator surveys track satisfaction (target: >8/10)
- [ ] Creator advisory board for major feature decisions
- [ ] Monthly creator success webinars (in regional languages)

### What This Value Prevents

- ❌ Changing payout rates without creator consent
- ❌ Hidden platform fees or deductions
- ❌ Prioritizing ad revenue over creator earnings
- ❌ One-sided contract changes
- ❌ Treating creators as expendable

## Value 2: Safety

### What This Value Means

## Values in Conflict Resolution

When values conflict, here's the priority order:

1. **Safety First:** All other values secondary to user/creator safety
2. **Creator-First:** Creator sustainability prioritized over user acquisition
3. **Transparency:** Clear communication about decisions and trade-offs
4. **Accessibility:** Expand reach without compromising other values

**Example:** If moderation requires slowing growth (conflicts with user acquisition):
- Safety wins → slower growth is acceptable
- Transparency → explain the reason to users
- Accessibility → ensure diverse moderation team, no language barriers in reporting

## Open Questions

1. **Accessibility Scope:** Should we include disability accessibility (screen readers, captions) in V1, or defer to V2?
2. **Values in Conflict:** Are there other scenarios where values might conflict that should be documented?
3. **Metrics:** Should we set quantitative targets for each value (e.g., 99% creator satisfaction)?
4. **Regional Expansion:** When adding new regional languages, should we maintain same moderation standards?
