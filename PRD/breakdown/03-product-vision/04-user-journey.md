| Starter | ₹99 | 100 | ₹0.99 | Trial, first purchase |
| Popular | ₹299 | 350 | ₹0.85 | Regular users |
| Value | ₹499 | 650 | ₹0.77 | Frequent gifters |

### Monetization Triggers

- Notification: "Creator appreciation coins available" (incentive)
- "Your account is low on coins - buy now" (gentle reminder)

**Hard Triggers (Blocking):**
- User tries to call but has 0 coins → "Buy coins to continue"
- User hits 5 free calls limit → "Subscribe for unlimited calling"
- User tries creator features without subscription → "Upgrade to Creator+"

### Payment Methods

| Method | Adoption | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Google Play In-App** | 90%+ | Easiest, familiar, Android standard |
| **Debit/Credit Card** | 5-10% | Direct payment, lower fees |
| **UPI** | 5-10% | Growing in India, instant |
| **Wallet (future)** | TBD | LIVVLY's own wallet for retention |

### User Mindset During Monetization
- "Is spending ₹100 worth it for this experience?"
- "What value am I getting for my coins?"
- "Can I get refunded if I change my mind?"
- "How much am I actually spending per month?"
- "(For creators) When do I get paid? Is it trustworthy?"

### Monetization Metrics Targets
- [ ] 10-15% of users convert to paid (ARPU ₹200-300/month)
- [ ] 3-5% become subscription subscribers
- [ ] Creator payout satisfaction > 8.5/10

## Open Questions

1. **Journey Duration:** How long should each stage ideally last? (Current: Day 0-1 for onboarding, Week 1-4 for engagement, Week 3+ for monetization)
2. **Conversion Target:** Is 10-15% paid conversion realistic, or should we target higher/lower?
3. **Creator Journey:** Should creator onboarding be separate from user onboarding, or same path?
4. **Failure Cases:** How do we re-engage users who completed onboarding but didn't engage?
5. **Return Users:** What's the journey for users who lapsed but return?
