## Summary

This section resolved critical conflicts between original PRD Section 4 and previously documented requirements (Market Analysis, Product Vision). Key decisions: 75-85% creator revenue share (not 45-65%), no free tier (not "5 free calls/day"), detailed 5-stream revenue model, and comprehensive financial projections showing LIVVLY exceeds business goals by 220-275%.
