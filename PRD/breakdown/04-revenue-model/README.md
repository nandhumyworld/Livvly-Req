## Documents in This Section

### 1. **Revenue Streams** (01-revenue-streams.md)
Three primary revenue sources and their mechanics.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Coins (70%):** Virtual currency users buy and gift to creators
- **Subscriptions (25%):** Three tiers (Free, VIP ₹199, Premium ₹499)
- **Ads (5%):** Rewarded videos, banner ads, native placements

**Psychological Pricing:**
- ₹99 (entry), ₹299 (featured), ₹499 (transition), ₹999 (anchor), ₹1999 (whale)
- Multiple tiers create "good, better, best" perception
- Mid-tier anchored as "popular"

---

### 2. **Revenue Split Model** (02-revenue-split.md)
How revenue flows from user to creators, platforms, and payment processors.

**Primary Model: High Creator Share (Recommended)**
- Google Play: 30%
- LIVVLY: 24.5% (35% of net)
- Creator (Gross): 45.5% (65% of net)
- TDS (10%): -9.1%
- **Creator (Net): 40.95%**

**Alternatives:**
- Standard Split (31.5% creator) - Not competitive
- Agency Model (23.6% creator) - For multi-channel creators

**Key Features:**
- T+1 payouts (next business day)
- Transparent earnings dashboard
- Compliance with TDS, GST, AML regulations

---

### 3. **Pricing Strategy** (03-pricing-strategy.md)
Psychological pricing for coins and value-based pricing for subscriptions.

**Coin Pricing (Psychological):**
- Multiple tiers create anchoring effects
- ₹299 featured as "Popular" (social proof)
- ₹999 as high anchor (makes ₹299 seem reasonable)
- Dynamic pricing by user segment (new, lapsed, power, subscription users)

**Subscription Strategy (Value-Based, 3-Tier):**
- Free (₹0): 5 calls/day, ads
- VIP (₹199): Unlimited calls, 20% coin discount
- Premium (₹499): Priority matching, 30% coin discount, analytics

**Pricing Tactics:**
- Charm pricing (.99 endings)
- Bundle offers (coin + subscription combos)
- Seasonal promotions
- Regional localization

---

### 4. **Unit Economics** (04-unit-economics.md)
Financial viability metrics: ARPU, CAC, LTV, Payback Period.

**Key Metrics:**
- **ARPU:** ₹200-350/month (by phase)
- **CAC:** ₹20-50 (blended across channels)
- **LTV:** ₹2,000+ (excellent)
- **Payback:** 7-15 days (sustain < 1 month standard)

**Profitability Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Growth phase (losses accepted)
- Months 6-9: Breakeven achieved
- Months 12+: ₹15Cr+/month profitability

**Segment Economics:**
- Regular users (70%): Sustainable
- Heavy users (20%): Extremely valuable
- Casual users (10%): Unprofitable if acquired via paid
