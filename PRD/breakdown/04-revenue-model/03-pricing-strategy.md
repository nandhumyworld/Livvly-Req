## Overview

LIVVLY employs **psychological pricing** strategy for coins (multiple tiers with anchoring) and **value-based pricing** for subscriptions (simplified 3-tier model). This approach maximizes monetization while remaining accessible to Tier-2/3 markets.

---

## Coin Pricing Strategy: Psychological Pricing

### Principle: Create Multiple Anchors

Users perceive prices relative to alternatives. Multiple tier options create "good, better, best" perception, anchoring mid-tier as standard.

### Coin Pricing Tiers

| Price | Coins | Cost/Coin | Perceived Value | Psychology |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **₹99** | 100 | ₹0.99 | Low (entry) | "Try it out" price |
| **₹299** | 400 | ₹0.747 | Medium (best) | "Best value" marked |
| **₹499** | 700 | ₹0.714 | High (good) | Transition tier |
| **₹999** | 1600 | ₹0.624 | Highest (anchor) | "Bulk discount" anchor |
| **₹1999** | 3500 | ₹0.571 | Premium anchor | Whale tier |

### Psychological Mechanisms

#### 1. Entry Price (₹99)
**Purpose:** Lower barrier to first purchase
- Low risk, high conversion (users willing to try)
- Psychology: "Only ₹99 is affordable for trial"
- Placement: Prominent on coin purchase screen
- Offer: "First purchase bonus +50% coins"

**Conversion Goal:** 30% of users → first coin purchase within week 1-2

---

#### 2. Featured/Best Value (₹299)
**Purpose:** Anchor as "best value" option
- Positioned as "Popular" or "Best Value" (social proof)
- Price sweet spot for regular spenders
- Psychology: "Others choose this; it must be optimal"
- Discount relative to ₹99: 25% better value (₹0.747 vs ₹0.99)

**Conversion Goal:** 60% of paying users → prefer ₹299 packages

**Tactics:**
- Show "Popular" badge
- Display "★★★★★ 15,234 users chose this"
- Prominence: Highlight mid-tier on purchase screen

---

#### 3. Transition Tier (₹499)
**Purpose:** For users between mid and heavy spending
- Price increase is small (₹200 more than ₹299)
- But value increase substantial (75% more coins)
- Psychology: "Slight increase in spend, major value gain"
- Users who hit coin limits quickly naturally upgrade here

**Conversion Goal:** 25% of paying users → choose ₹499 for better value

---

#### 4. Bulk/Anchor (₹999)
**Purpose:** Anchor the market, make other tiers seem reasonable
- Highest price available (makes ₹499 seem cheaper)
- Best value per coin (₹0.624) - but requires highest upfront spend
- Psychology: "Too expensive for me, so ₹299 is reasonable"
- Used by power users/whales

**Conversion Goal:** 10% of paying users → choose ₹999 regularly

---

#### 5. Ultra-Premium (₹1999)
**Purpose:** Monetize whales, create aspirational tier
- Only 1-2% of user base reaches this
- Highest value per coin (₹0.571)
- Psychology: Luxury positioning, exclusivity
- May include special perks (VIP status, early access)

**Conversion Goal:** 2% of paying users → occasional ₹1999 purchase

---

## Dynamic Pricing by User Segment

### New Users (First 7 days)
- Only see ₹99 and ₹299 options
- Bonus offer: First purchase gets +50% coins
- Example: Buy ₹99 → Get 150 coins instead of 100
- Goal: Lower first-purchase friction

### Lapsed Users (Returning after gap)
- Retargeting offer: "Return offer: 30% bonus coins"
- Emphasis: ₹299 as "catch-up" option
- Example: "You've been away. Come back with 520 coins for ₹299"

### Power Users (High lifetime spend >₹10k)
- Unlock loyalty tier: ₹1999 option
- Exclusive VIP coins: Coins with 15% bonus (limited time)
- Subscription upsell: Premium tier includes coin boost

### Subscription Users
- Instant coin discount: 20-30% off all purchases
- Example: VIP member buys ₹299 → Gets 520 coins (not 400)
- Creates virtuous loop: Subscribe → Buy coins cheaper → Spend more

---

## Subscription Pricing Strategy: Value-Based

### Revised Subscription Tiers (3-Tier Model)

Based on clarification feedback: Consolidate from 4 tiers to 3 tiers for simplicity.

| Plan | Price | Features | ARPU/Month | Target Segment |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Free** | ₹0 | 5 calls/day, browse, limited rooms | ₹0 (ads only) | Everyone |
| **VIP** | ₹199/month | Unlimited calls, 20% coin discount, badge | ₹199+ coins | Regular users |
| **Premium** | ₹499/month | All VIP + priority matching, 30% coin discount, analytics | ₹499+ coins | Power users |

**Note:** Creator+ (₹999) moved to separate "Creator Dashboard" or free upgrade for verified creators.

### Tier 1: Free Plan

**Price:** ₹0 (Freemium model)

**Features:**
- 5 voice calls per day (hard limit, resets midnight)
- Unlimited room browsing
- Basic profile features
- Ad-supported (rewarded + display ads)
- No coin discount

**Psychology:**
- Meaningful free experience (not crippled)
- Daily limit creates return habit
- Day 3-5: Hits limit → Conversion opportunity

**Monetization Path:**
- Free user → Hits limit → Sees "Subscribe for unlimited"
- Conversion target: 10% of free users → VIP within 30 days

---

### Tier 2: VIP Plan

**Price:** ₹199/month (₹6.60/day, "Less than a coffee")

**Features:**
- ✅ Unlimited calls (no daily limit)
- ✅ 20% coin discount (₹99 → ₹79, ₹299 → ₹239)
- ✅ VIP badge on profile (signal to others)
- ✅ Notification priority (your messages stand out)
- ✅ No ads (removes rewarded video ads)

**Not Included:**
- ❌ Priority matching (users see you first)
- ❌ Creator analytics
- ❌ Premium features

**Psychology:**
- **Low price point:** Psychological barrier < ₹200
- **Unlimited calls:** Main frustration point resolved
- **Coin discount:** Indirect monetization (users spend more coins)
- **Badge:** Status symbol (visible to matches)

**Monetization:**
- VIP subscription: ₹199/month = ₹2,388/year
- VIP user coin spend: Avg ₹100/month → ₹79/month after discount = -₹252/year
- Net ARPU (subscription + coins): ~₹2,100/year per VIP user

**Conversion Target:** 10% of DAU → VIP subscribers

---

### Tier 3: Premium Plan

**Price:** ₹499/month (₹16.60/day, "Price of lunch")

**Features:**
- ✅ All VIP features (unlimited calls, 20% coin discount, badge, no ads)
- ✅ **Priority Matching** - Users see your profile first
- ✅ **Creator Analytics** - If you go live, see viewer stats, gifts, earnings
- ✅ 30% coin discount (₹99 → ₹69, ₹299 → ₹209)
- ✅ Premium tag (premium member status)

**Psychology:**
- **Priority matching:** Next pain point resolved (why am I not getting matches?)
- **Analytics:** Monetization-ready (prepares for creator path)
- **Higher discount:** Further incentivizes coin spend
- **Premium status:** Aspirational tier

**Monetization:**
- Premium subscription: ₹499/month = ₹5,988/year
- Premium user coin spend: Avg ₹200/month → ₹140/month after discount = -₹720/year
- Net ARPU (subscription + coins): ~₹5,200/year per Premium user

**Conversion Target:** 3% of DAU → Premium subscribers

---

### Tier 4 Removed: Creator+ (Was ₹999)

**Reasoning for removal:**
- Creator+ functionality (analytics, promotion) moved to Premium
- Simpler subscription funnel (3 tiers instead of 4)
- Verified creators get free analytics upgrade
- Reduces complexity for average users

**New Approach:**
- All Premium users can use creator tools
- Verified creators unlocked via KYC (not separate subscription)
- Premium tier becomes "Creator-Ready" tier

---

## Pricing Localization

### Regional Price Adaptation

Consider regional purchasing power in Tier-2/3 cities:

| Region | Adjustment | Example Prices |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Tier-1 (Delhi, Mumbai)** | -10% (less discount needed) | ₹99, ₹299, ₹499 |
| **Tier-2 (Bengaluru, Chennai)** | Baseline | ₹99, ₹299, ₹499 |
| **Tier-3 (Smaller cities)** | +10% volume, not price | Same prices, more promotions |

**Rationale:**
- Tier-1 users have higher purchasing power (can pay full price)
- Tier-3 users price-sensitive; better to increase volume with promotions
- Don't reduce subscription prices (brand dilution); instead run discount promotions

---

## Pricing Tactics Over Time

### Month 1-2: Launch Pricing
- Full pricing as outlined
- First-purchase bonuses for coins (50% extra)
- VIP trials: "First month ₹99" (promote adoption)

### Month 3-4: Consolidation
- Remove first-purchase bonuses (baseline pricing)
- Introduce loyalty pricing (returning users get 10% coin bonus)
- Monitor conversion funnels; adjust if needed

### Month 6: Optimization
- Data-driven adjustments based on cohort behavior
- A/B test: Try ₹249 vs ₹299 for mid-tier (if ₹299 underperforms)
- Regional pricing variations (if data supports)

### Month 9-12: Premium Tiers
- Ultra-tier users (>₹1,00,000 lifetime spend): Invite-only VIP
- Special pricing for power creators (extra discount for promotion)
- Annual subscriptions: VIP ₹1,999/year (17% discount vs monthly)

---

## Payment Methods

### Primary: Google Play In-App Purchase
- **Adoption:** 85-90% of users (default, pre-installed)
- **Commission:** 30% to Google
- **Flow:** Frictionless (one-tap purchase with saved payment)

### Secondary: Direct Payment (Web)
- **Adoption:** 5-10% of users (those who prefer direct)
- **Commission:** 2-3% payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe)
- **Methods:** Credit card, debit card, UPI
- **When:** User clicks "Buy elsewhere" → Web payment flow

### Tertiary: UPI Direct
- **Adoption:** 5-10% (growing in India)
- **Commission:** 0.5-1% to UPI provider
- **Flow:** In-app UPI intent (fast, low friction)

---

## Pricing Psychology: Further Refinements

### Charm Pricing
- Use .99 endings: ₹99, ₹199, ₹299, ₹499, ₹999 (not ₹100, ₹200, ₹300)
- Psychology: ₹99 feels like single-digit price, not ₹100
- Applicable to all tiers (subscriptions stay at .00 for premium feel)

### Price Anchoring
- Display full price vs. discount: "Save ₹100! Was ₹399, now ₹299"
- Reference pricing: "VIP badges cost ₹500+ in other apps, free here"
- Percentage discounts: "20% off coins" resonates more than "₹20 off"

### Bundle Offers
- Limited-time bundles: "Get ₹499 package + ₹99 bonus = ₹999 value"
- Seasonal bundles: Festival offer (e.g., Pongal special bundle)
- Subscription + coins: "VIP + 400 coins for ₹299" (vs. separate ₹199+₹299)
